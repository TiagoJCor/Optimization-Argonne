# Optimization-Argonne

Implementation of parallel variable transformation and coordinate descent algorithms for unconstrained optimization. This work was done as part of my internship at the MCS Division of Argonne National Laboratory. Parallelization is simulated by running processes sequentially.

For an explanation of the methods used see "Testing Parallel Variable Transformation" by Yamakawa & Fukushima (1999) and "Coordinate Descent Algorithms" by Stephen Wright (2015).
